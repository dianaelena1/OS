  1         Write a shell script which takes as parameters two integers. The
            script will display the sum, the difference and the product of the
            two given integers.

  2         Write a shell script which takes as parameters two names of text
            files. The script will compare the two text files line by line and
            display the first 3 text lines that differ.

  3         Write a shell script that takes a natural number as parameter. The
            script will check whether the given number is prime or not.

  4         Write a shell script that reads numbers from keyboard (the reading
            stops when the user has entered the number 0). The script will
            display the sum of numbers entered from the keyboard.

  5         Write a shell script that reads usernames from keyboard. For each
            user, the script will display the number of times it was logged in
            to the server in the current month. If he/she has not logged in at
            all during the current month, the script will display the message:
            *\"User X has never logged in during the current month\"*.

  6         Write a shell script that reads words from keyboard (the reading
            stops when the user has entered the word \"stop\"). The script
            will display the list of words entered from the keyboard.

  7         Write a shell script which takes as parameter a directory name.
            The script will determine the total number of lines in all ASCII
            text files in this directory and its subdirectories. It is assumed
            that any directory will only contain ASCII text files.

  8         Write a shell script which takes as parameters two file names (a
            file that contains usernames and a file that contains any text).
            The script will send a mail to each user in the first file (the
            mail message will be the text in the second file).

  9         Write a shell script which takes as parameter a username. The
            script will count and display the number of processes that belong
            to that user.

  10        Write a shell script which takes as parameter an existing group
            number (ex: 821). The script will display the details about that
            group.

  11        Write a shell script which lists the content of the current
            directory. The script will list the files as follows: sorted by
            file names, sorted by last modified date and sorted by file size.

  12        Write a shell script which takes as parameter a directory name.
            The script will display the filename, and the first 3 lines of
            each ASCII text file found in that directory.

  13        Write a shell script which takes as parameter a username (ex:
            bdae0198). The script will determine the section (extract the
            letters on positions 3 and 4) and the sum of all digits in the
            username.

  14        Write a shell script which displays all files in the current
            directory and its subdirectories that have write permission for
            the group of which the owner belongs.
