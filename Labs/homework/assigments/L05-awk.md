  1         Write a shell script which takes as parameters a short month name
            followed by a day number (ex: Mar 8). For each possible 4 hours
            interval, the script will display the time interval (hh:mm-hh:mm)
            and the average number of users that were connected to the server
            on that date and within that time frame.

  2         Write a shell script that takes a group name (ex: gr821) as a
            parameter. The script will display the given group name followed
            by the list of all students that belong to that group. Each line
            in the student list will contain the username of the student
            followed by its full name.

  3         Write a shell script which takes as parameters several file names.
            The script will display the ratio of the number of lowercase
            letters to the number of uppercase letters in each given file (ex:
            file1.txt l/U = 95/12).

  4         Write a shell script which takes as parameters several file names.
            The script will display the lines containing the same word in
            consecutive positions in the given files. Each line will be
            prefixed with its number and the word involved.

  5         Write a shell script which takes as parameters several file names.
            For each line in the given files which contains more than 10
            characters, the script will display the number of that line and
            its content starting from the 11th character. At the end of each
            file analysis, the script will display the file name and the
            number of lines that have been displayed before.

  6         Write a shell script which takes as parameters several file names.
            For each given file, the script will display its name and the
            average number of words per line. At the end, the script will
            display also the average number of words per file.

  7         Write a shell script which takes as parameters several file names.
            For each line in the given files which contains more than 20
            characters, the script will display the number of that line, the
            first word and the last word.

  8         Write a shell script which takes as parameters several file names.
            For each file, the script will display the name of the file, the
            sum of the numbers on each line in that file and the ratio of the
            lines l1 that contain numbers to the lines l2 that do not contain
            numbers (ex: file1 sum = 1234 l1/l2 = 3/5).

  9         Write a shell script that takes as parameters several file names.
            For each line in the given files in which a word appears 2 or more
            times, the script will display the number of that line, and the
            word involved.

  10        Write a shell script which takes as parameters several file names.
            The script will display the number of files, the average number of
            words per file and the total word count.

  11        Write a shell script which takes as parameters several file names.
            The script will display the name of the file which contains the
            highest number of words and the word count.

  12        Write a shell script which takes as parameters two words followed
            by several file names. The script will replace any occurrence of
            the first word with the second word in each line of the given
            files.

  13        Write a shell script that takes as parameters a short month name
            followed by a day number and a time interval (ex: Mar 8
            11.00-12.00). The script will display the usernames and the total
            number of users that were connected to the server on that date and
            within that time frame.

  14        Write a shell script which takes as parameter a time interval
            (hh:mm-hh:mm). The script will display the average number of users
            that were connected to the server in the given time interval.

  15        Write a shell script which takes as parameters several file names.
            The script will display the ratio of the number of vowels to the
            number of consonants in each given file (ex: file1.txt v/c =
            22/47).
