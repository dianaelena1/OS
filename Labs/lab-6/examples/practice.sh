# 1. Write a bash script that reads filenames and checks for each file:
#    - How many words are in the first line?
#    - The total file size.
#    - Perform all required validations on the input data.

# Check if at least one filename is provided as an argument
if [ $# -lt 1 ]; then
    echo "No filenames provided"
    exit 1
fi

# 3. Write a shell script that receives a natural number N and generates N text files:
#    - The filenames will be of the form: file_X, where X = {1,2,…, N}.
#    - Each file will contain lines X to X+5 from /etc/passwd.

# 4. Calculate the average of all process IDs in the system per user.
#    - Retrieve all process IDs grouped by user.
#    - Compute the average PID per user.

# 5. Write a shell script that checks each command-line argument:
#    - If it’s a file, print its name, number of characters, and lines.
#    - If it’s a directory, print its name and count the number of files it contains (including subdirectories).

# 6. Write a script that receives triplets of command-line arguments (filename, word, number) and:
#    - Validates input data.

# 7. Write a script that:
#    - Finds all users in /etc/passwd.
#    - Creates a file with their username as the filename.
#    - Stores all IP addresses from which that user has logged in.

#!/bin/bash

# 9. Create a bash script that:
#    - Displays every second the process count per user, sorted in descending order by process count.
#    - If no arguments are given, displays results for all users.
#    - If usernames are provided, validates them before displaying results.

# 10. Write a shell script that:
#    - Receives any number of words as command-line arguments.
#    - Continuously reads from the keyboard one file name at a time.
#    - Ends when all words received as parameters have been found at least once across the given files.
